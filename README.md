## Creating your first drawing

To use PixiePal, PixiePal is written in Java 8. It can be compiled and published to an executable jar file.

The current version of PixiePal only has one drawing tool, your mouse. You can click individual pixels or click and drag your mouse over pixels to paint them.

## Changing colors

The right-hand menu has a color picker button. The button displays the current active color. To change the color, click on the button and select a new color. 

To create a custom color, click on "Custom Color" at the bottom.

## Save and loading drawings

The current version of PixiePal can save drawing data to and load data from text files. 

## Clear Canvas

To start a new drawing click the "New" button. This will clear the canvas and all drawing data. **This cannot be undone.**
